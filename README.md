# Appraisal of a Building
This project starts when **Brickbro**, a real state company, asks me to build a database and a model for doing appraisals to buildings.

In order to start doing this task I had to learn how to do web scraping. I've used a **Tutorial** made by **Kimberly Fessel** on the **PyCon 2020**.

This is just a prototype and it's still being built. Since this program would be sold, once finished, I will upgrade this code but it won't be completed in order not to replicate it. Until then, since this won't be read by almost anyone I'm updating it here completely.

The scraping it's made on *www.habitaclia.com*

For any possible correction you can write me on tonidome@gmail.com I'll be happy to hear from you.
